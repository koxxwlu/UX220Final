    Between the two syntaxes, the following won't work because the form action was set to localhost, which some location direction to a local destinaion. Unless there are specific programmes/scripts written for this location, there won't be a server to register or store the information user submits, unlike the second syntax which provides a server location as URL so the user's input will be processed properly (if the server logics were setup correctly).
    <form action="http://localhost:3002/send/" method="post"> ... </form>
