        <h2>Ways .pngs are superior to .jpgs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>.png preserve transparent backgounds or opacity.</li>
            <li>.png is an uncompressed format, preserving much more data/details.</li>
            <li>.png supports up to 48 bits of colour, providing greater colour data compard to .jpg which caps at 24 bits (Eg. png would provide larger range of colours, and gradients would look more seamless than on jpgs).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ways .pngs are inferior to .jpgs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>While preserving refined details and trasparency, .pngs often have relatively larger size than .jpg, which takes up a lot of storage if a large amount of them are stored.</li>
            <li>.png can be confusing to people unfamiliar to them, as some might wonder why a part of an image (the transparent elements) would sometimes appear blank/black (or sometimes solid white in certain softwares).</li>
